# Breadboard

> A **breadboard**, also known as a **solderless breadboard** or **protoboard**, is a base used for building semi-permanent electronic circuit prototypes. Unlike perfboards or stripboards, breadboards do not require soldering, making them reusable and ideal for educational or experimental purposes.

## 🕰 History

Originally, hobbyists and engineers used wooden boards—sometimes actual bread-cutting boards—to mount copper strips or terminals, connecting components with solder. Early schematics were sometimes glued to the board as layout guides.

Significant milestones include:
- **1960**: Orville Thompson (DeVry Tech) patented a solderless breadboard with spring-metal contacts.
- **1971**: Ronald Portugal (E&L Instruments) patented the modern layout with 0.1” spacing, compatible with DIP ICs.

## 🛠 Design

### 🧩 Structure

A modern breadboard consists of:
- **Perforated plastic block** with spring clips (phosphor bronze or nickel silver)
- **Tie points** (common: 400–830)
- **Standard pitch**: 0.1" (2.54 mm)

Integrated circuits in **DIP** packages are inserted across a central notch. Components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) and jumper wires connect to remaining holes.

Typical ratings:
- 1A at 5V
- 0.33A at 15V

### ⚡️ Bus and Terminal Strips

- **Terminal strips**: central area for components, with 5 connected clips per row (columns A–E and F–J)
- **Bus strips**: power and ground rails, usually marked red and blue/black

Configurations:
- **Mini**: ~17 rows
- **Half-size**: ~30 rows
- **Full-size**: ~64 rows (up to 830 points)

Some bus strips connect full columns; others are segmented to reduce interference.

### 🔌 Jump Wires

Used to interconnect components:
- Best wire: 22 AWG solid copper (stripped 4.8–7.9 mm)
- Available as:
  - Pre-cut & pre-stripped sets (sometimes color-coded)
  - Handmade with wire strippers and pliers

Color discipline is common, e.g.:
- Red: Vcc
- Black/Blue: GND
- Others: signal lines

### 🔧 Advanced Designs

High-end or robust breadboards may include:
- Mounted metal backplate with binding posts
- Built-in power supplies or signal generators
- Logic probes, serial interfaces, displays

For **high-frequency prototyping**, techniques like "dead bug" style (upside-down ICs soldered on copper planes) are used to reduce parasitic effects.

## 💡 Uses

Breadboards are often used with microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino, STM32) mounted on breakout boards with 0.1" headers.

Common uses:
- Testing peripherals like GPIO, UART, SPI, I²C, ADC, PWM
- Developing embedded firmware
- Rapid SoC prototyping at low cost

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

Breadboards have physical and electrical limits:
- **Parasitic capacitance**: ~2 pF between columns
- **High inductance/resistance**: affects signal integrity
- **Frequency ceiling**: ~10 MHz
- **Poor compatibility** with SMD or non-DIP components (requires breakout adapters)
- **Low current/voltage tolerance**
- **Unreliable for complex circuits** due to wiring chaos and contact degradation over time

Adapters for SMD components exist, but they often require soldering, reducing the “solderless” benefit.

## 🔄 Alternatives

- **Perfboards / Stripboards**: require soldering, more permanent
- **Custom PCBs**: for advanced and stable designs
- **Simulation Software**: like LTSpice, Proteus, and Tinkercad Circuits
- **Modular kits**: like Lectron blocks or magnetic circuits
